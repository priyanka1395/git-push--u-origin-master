Q1: What is PHP?

Ans: PHP stands for PHP Hypertext Processor. 
It?s a server side scripting language generally used for making web based applications and dynamic websites. In 1995, Rasmus Lerdorf created PHP and it was one of the first scripting languages that could be embedded inside plain HTML.

Q2: Difference between include and require functions?

Ans:Both these functions differ in how they handle failures that occur. Suppose a file is not found by the include() function, then it will simply give a warning and script execution will not be interrupted. However, if a file is not found using a require() function, it will throw up a fatal warning and stop the script execution.

Q4: What is the difference between GET and POST functions?

POST function is used when there is a visible change on the state of the world. When we use a POST function,  normally the system changes. E.g. when we add, delete or modify values from a database. A simple example is a form submission.

Ans:There are two different ways to combine variables in PHP. Let?s take an example.

We can combine it using the two codes below
